# Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Risk Stress Testing

## Objective
To assess portfolio risk using Monte Carlo simulation and stress testing under varying volatility and correlation regimes.

## Applications
- Portfolio risk management  
- Stress testing and scenario analysis  
- Quantitative finance research  

## Methodology
- Historical return estimation from market data  
- Covariance and correlation modelling  
- Multivariate Monte Carlo simulation  
- Scenario-based stress testing  
- Distributional analysis of terminal portfolio values  

## Key Insight
Expected returns are relatively stable across scenarios, while downside risk is highly sensitive to volatility and correlation assumptions.
